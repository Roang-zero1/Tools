# Linux and Windows Tools

This is my personal tools collection which includes my dotfiles, some Windows Documentation and scripts written for development convenience.

## Setup

Once you clone the repository you can use the init.sh or init.bat files to set up the environment.

However most of these inits are limited to specific servers, due to this you will have to pick the ones that fit and match them accordingly.

## ZSH

Plugins and themes are loaded with [zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen)
